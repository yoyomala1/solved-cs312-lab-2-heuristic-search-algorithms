Task 2: Heuristic Search Algorithms

Domain for this assignment is : Blocks World Domain â€“Blocks World Domain Game starts with an initial state consisting of a fixed number of blocks arranged in 3 stacks and we can move only top blocks of the stacks and we have to achieve a goal state that is a particular arrangement of blocks by moving these blocks. Blocks World is a planning problem where we know goal state beforehand and path to Goal state is more important

For the above domain implement the following search algorithms:

<ol>

 <li>Best First Search :Try out a minimum of 3 different heuristic functions and compare the results with valid reasoning. Use a priority queue for the OPEN list to make it computationally efficient.</li>

 <li>Hill Climbing :With a slight modification of code, implement Hill Climbing for the domain.</li>

</ol>

Compare the performance of the two in terms of time and space.
